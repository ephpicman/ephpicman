# 👋 Hi, I'm Sina Kuhestani (aka EphpicMan)

[![Hire Me](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hire%20Me-Open%20to%20Work-2ea44f?style=for-the-badge)](https://linkedin.com/in/ephpicman)

Senior PHP developer, framework architect, and open-source builder.  
I design **clean, performant, and expressive systems**—mostly around PHP, Laravel, WordPress internals, and mathematical libraries.

I care deeply about:
- Architecture over hacks
- Long-term maintainability
- Explicit design decisions
- Code that explains itself

## 🚀 What I’m working on

### 🧮 Numerus
A **scientific-grade numerical and matrix library for PHP**  
Designed with strong typing, optimized storage models, and explicit math semantics.

Key ideas:
- Multiple matrix storage strategies (dense, diagonal, symmetric, triangular, scalar)
- Lazy computation with deterministic behavior
- Zero magic, zero hidden costs

> Numerus is built as if PHP were a serious numerical language — because it can be.

### 🧩 Ephpic Ecosystem
A growing ecosystem focused on **modern PHP architecture inside WordPress**.

Main principles:
- Laravel-inspired structure without Laravel dependency
- Modular services, clean boundaries
- WordPress without WordPress-style chaos

This is not “yet another plugin”.  
It’s an **engineering-first framework**.

## 🛠 Tech stack

**Backend**
- PHP 8.2+
- Laravel (API & services)
- WordPress core & internals
- Composer, PHPUnit, Psalm

**Frontend**
- TypeScript
- SCSS
- Pug
- Gulp-based build systems

**Architecture**
- SOLID, DDD-inspired design
- Explicit contracts & abstractions
- Performance-aware design (not premature, not lazy)

---

## 🧠 How I think about code

- If it’s hard to name, the design is wrong
- Performance is a feature, not an afterthought
- “Simple” is earned, not rushed
- Frameworks should **disappear**, not dominate

I prefer **fewer features done right** over many half-done ideas.

---

## 🌍 Long-term vision

- Build impactful open-source PHP libraries
- Create a sustainable engineering-driven business
- Publish technical and conceptual writing
- Contribute tools that raise the PHP ecosystem’s standards
